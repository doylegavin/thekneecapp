Songs are stored as JSON files with this structure:
```json
{
  "id": "song-id",
  "title": "Song Title",
  "titleEnglish": "English Title",
  "album": "Album Name",
  "year": 2024,
  "primaryLanguage": "mixed",
  "lines": [
    {
      "type": "section",
      "section": "Verse 1"
    },
    {
      "irish": "Irish lyrics here",
      "english": "English translation here"
    }
  ]
