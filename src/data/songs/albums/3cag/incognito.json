Incognito Lyrics
(Gaeilge labhartha Bh√©al Feirste. Mod√∫l a haon: "Incognito")

'Gul s√≠os ar an snaois, you're sniffing the coke
T√° t√∫ ag iarraidh c√∫pla smailc, you're looking a wee smoke
Tr√≠ chonsan agus guta, that's Molly or MD
"An bhfuil cead agam eochair?", if you fancy a key
And if you can't grasp that, say Mic√≠ Dain√≠n
Or if he's mad for the coke, then he's a 'snaois√≠n'
If you don't have a 'dom, then you have no coisc√≠n
Kneecap,, gan stop, anois a bhuachaill√≠

You say "Foc me!" when you see na Garda√≠
'Nother one for the cops is "Fuck the RUC!"
As well as that we have na fir bu√≠
Just connigh s√∫il amach do na bastard√≠
So m√°s maith leat an phit, you like a bit of gee
N√≥ m√°s fearr leat an bod, you like getting the D
M√°s maith leat green dul s√≠os go teach Aoidh
Seo an 3CAG crew le focain ceacht inniu

[Curf√°/Chorus]
C√©im a haon to being incognito:
Las an d√∫id agus just foghlaim an lingo
C√©im a d√≥ for avoidin' the law:
Caith do focain bally gach aon l√°
Is c√©im a tr√≠, seo an ceann is t√°bhachta√≠
Just n√° focain √©ist le RT√â
N√° focain √©ist le RT√â
Just n√° focain √©ist le RT√â

Kneecap
T√° na leaids ar fad cloch√°ilte, we're stoned to the bone
T√° t√∫ ag iarraidh a bheith foc√°ilte, cur snaois i do shr√≥n
'Fear glic' is a housebreaker up in Malone
Ag goideadh airgid √≥ rich cunts and taking it home
'Gan airgead' is skint, mar a bh√≠onn de ghn√°th
You can't pay for drugs so you get tic gach l√°
'P√≠on√≥s point√≠' is penalty points
The Stinging Roger is the driobla√≠n at the end of your joints
An phit is a gee, minge, fanny or a flirt
If you're fucked from last night, t√° tinneas p√≥it ort
What you need is a wee bit of faoiseamh b√©il
But steal her cac and cuir √© suas i Shankill Buy and Sell

Incognito, just follow na rialacha
Cur do dope i bhfolach 'is hide your paraphernalia
A brathad√≥ir is a Tout, but sure they're always afraid of ya
And if you're fucking grannied then look at the fucking state of ya

[Curf√°/Chorus]
C√©im a haon to being incognito:
Las an d√∫id agus just foghlaim an lingo
C√©im a d√≥ for avoidin' the law:
Caith do focain bally gach aon l√°
Is c√©im a tr√≠, seo an ceann is t√°bhachta√≠
Just n√° focain √©ist le RT√â
N√° focain √©ist le RT√â
Just n√° focain √©ist le RT√â
When you see your mate, you say "‚ÄôD√© an fucking craic?"
N√≥ "Cad √© mar at√°" if you wanna be polite
You say "Maith go leor!" if you think he's alright
Or if he's l√°n de cac that means he's full of shite
A d√∫id m√≥r ramhar is a busty joint
And you always speak the lingo at a Garda checkpoint
Ach rud amhain eile sula nd√©anaimid dearmad;
You say "Na S√© Chontae" for the North of Ireland
[UPPA RA]

Kneecap, tr√≠ chonsan agus guta crew
Ag m√∫ineadh achan duine √≥g at√° i gC√∫ige Uladh
T√° muid beagnach cr√≠ochnaithe don l√° inni√∫
Ach incognito will be continued
But one more time roimh deireadh an rang
Abair √≥s ard don fuckin' 3CAG gang
If you want to be incognito like me
T√≥g‚Äô bhur bpeann is p√°ip√©ar agus scr√≠obhaig√≠

[Curf√°/Chorus]
C√©im a haon to being incognito:
Las an d√∫id agus just foghlaim an lingo
C√©im a d√≥ for avoidin' the law:
Caith do focain bally gach aon l√°
Is c√©im a tr√≠, seo an ceann is t√°bhachta√≠
Just n√° focain √©ist le RT√â
N√° focain √©ist le RT√â
Just n√° focain √©ist le RT√â
Right!
An bhfuil sibh ag focain √©isteacht?)

C√©im a haon to being incognito:
Las an d√∫id agus just foghlaim an lingo
C√©im a d√≥ for avoidin' the law:
Caith do focain bally gach aon l√°
Is c√©im a tr√≠, seo an ceann is t√°bhachta√≠
Just n√° focain √©ist le RT√â
N√° focain √©ist le RT√â
Just n√° focain √©ist le RT√â
