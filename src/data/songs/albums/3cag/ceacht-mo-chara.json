Ceacht Mo Chara Lyrics
F√°iltig√≠ go Ceacht mo Chara (Hello)
Foghlaim seo agus n√≠ bheidh t√∫ ag teacht sa dara h√°it
Banging out 3CAG agus m√© ar st√°itse
Ar seachr√°n √≥ na Garda√≠ √≥n tseachtain seo caite
T√° √©ad orthu mar gheall go bhfuil mo pubes ildaite
Faic f√°gtha le r√°

Don't change the drug laws because I‚Äôm raking it in gach l√°
Ach s√≠lim gur g√° do na P√©as iad f√©in a choinne√°il stuama
Ar Bh√≥thar na bhF√°l n√≠ bheidh t√∫ i bhfad ar shi√∫l √≥ phetrol-buama
Buama peitril ag √©ist' le techno beidh mise ar shi√∫l n√≠ bheidh mise le feice√°il
Garda√≠ ag seice√°il t√° mise ag pac√°il amach sna sl√©ibthe cos√∫il le jackal
'Cause that‚Äôs where I hide, n√≠l an RUC on my side
Just ar feadh c√∫pla, an m√©id sin, t√°im ar ais i focain paradise
An Gaeilgeoir 'Mr. Nice' a chuirtear orm
Ar f√°il fr√≠d an ghrian, ghaoth, bh√°ist√≠ agus stoirm
Mar t√° sneachta ann 'ar go' √≥ Mo Chara ar l√° tirim
Agus t√° Dan Healy paranoid faoi achan abairt a dheirim
Fuck the Pope, I'm selling dope le Bishop Brennan
Fuck the Queen, I'm selling green le achan cunt sa Kremlin
LSD n√≥ piolla√≠, focain d√≠olaim an t-ioml√°n
("How many should I take, Mo Chara said three or something?")

Pearsantachta√≠ difri√∫la when I'm selling an 3CAG
M√∫inte le posh pricks and acting hard leis na scumbags
Sometimes you have to bite your tongue leis na me√°naicmigh
Exactly, due the focain airgead sexy
Eventually, im√≠onn siad, couple o‚Äô quid down
The clowns, running around, saying that legend Mo Chara‚Äôs sound
Ach i bhf√≠rinne bh√≠ orm √© a dh√≠ol n√≠os daoire daofa
Mar b√≠m i gc√≥na√≠ ag iarraidh go mbeidh s√© n√≠os saoire do na
Leaids as an cheantar nach bhfaigheann laethanta saoire ar bith
Sniff that mate and you'll be back in Ibiza ar√≠s

[Curf√°/Chorus]
Mo Chara i do cheantar
Mo Chara i do theach
Mo Chara‚Äôs everywhere
Ar an drabhl√°s anocht

Mo Chara i do cheantar
Mo Chara i do theach
Mo Chara's everywhere
Ar an drabhl√°s anocht

Achan duine buartha faoi Mo Chara
Mar gheall go bhfuil barra√≠ocht ama aige
Mar go bhfuil barra√≠ocht b√°n aige
Mar gur as B√≥thar na Carraige
B√°ine d√≥
Is l√©ir go bhfuil Mo Chara the opposite the [?]
N√≠ imr√≠m cluich√≠ seachas Cribby 'is Dizzy Dinosaurs
Inseoidh m√© duit once more
N√≠ sh√≠lim i bhf√≠rinne gur ch√≥ir
√âisteacht le RT√â n√≥ beidh cuairteoir at your Ma's front door
Smashing up your radio then giving myself fellatio
I dteach do mh√°thar a gimp suit leathair
Hanging in her patio
I still prefer your Granny though
Burting her like a fanny coat
Horn agus f√©as√≥g uirthi, she look‚Äôs like a manly goat
Kneecap, givin' your Da a vesectomy
I'll beat your brother at FIFA when your Ma is erectin' me
T√° do dheirfi√∫r next to me, I'm selling her ecstasy
Rapping i nd√°theangach coursing through my anatomy

[Curf√°/Chorus]
Mo Chara i do cheantar
Mo Chara i do theach
Mo Chara's everywhere
Ar an drabhl√°s anocht

Mo Chara i do cheantar
Mo Chara i do theach
Mo Chara's everywhere
Ar an drabhl√°s anocht

C√∫pla siolla eile sure just don focain craic
Agus c√∫pla l√≠ne eile pure before I hit the sack
Nuair a dh√©anann na P√©as seic
Faigheann siad faic
Mar t√° mo dope about an inch and a half up my crack
De r√©ir boring bastards, t√° m√© drochbh√©asach
Ach ag d√©anamh a bheag de dhaoine is what I'm best at
Like when I wipe my arse with your wee sister's vest top
Agus chuir m√© i bhfolach √© in a charity shop (Eugh)
"√ì mo Dhia, t√° t√∫ focain c√°idheach"
Throw your baby into the fire
Achan duine th√≠os for the Messiah
N√≠ f√©idir liom b√°s a fh√°il and I'll never retire
T√° m√© imithe ar focain strae
Cuirim scairt ar focain Babestation i rith an lae
Melting heads, is bre√° liom √©
Cuirfidh m√© isteach ar dhaoine, go dt√≠ go dt√©im ag r√©'

[Curf√°/Chorus]
Mo Chara i do cheantar
Mo Chara i do theach
Mo Chara's everywhere
Ar an drabhl√°s anocht

Mo Chara i do cheantar
Mo Chara i do theach
Mo Chara's everywhere
Ar an drabhl√°s anocht
