Bouncers Lyrics
Half eight, pleasing not much of a top
No more m√°la fa choinne M√≥glai Bap
Fear √∫r nua ag f√°g√°il sl√°n leis an clap
‚ÄòNois beidh [?] ort muna n-√≠ocann t√∫ straip
L√©ine deas √∫r don o√≠che anocht
Agus dh√≠ol m√© deich kilo c√≥c so n√≠l me bocht
Gach uile dhuine hooked ach n√≠ ormsa an locht
Mar t√° Nike Air Max daor, thart fa ocht√≥ punt

Right, fast forward
Swig amh√°in eile, sip√≠n beag Stella, le cuidi√∫ le mo bhuama
Go f√≥ill stuama, Bouncer insan c√∫inne, looks like a welter
D√≠reach i m√≥ sh√∫ile
"Not tonight mate, I think you‚Äôve had enough"
So thug me dorn san aghaidh d√≥ agus bhris me a phus
Th√°inig ceann amh√°in eile boot c√∫l le mo chos
Just let me know mate when you‚Äôve had e-fucking-nough

Na bac leis an cac a tugann bouncers duit
Sure, t√° s√© beagnach tr√≠ bhliain √≥ a bholadh s√© phit
Agus n√≠ labhra√≠onn s√© lena mh√°thair
He says she's a bitch
Is focain cunt m√≥r ramhar √© ach t√° pleain agaim anois
Eagr√≥idh muid √°r √°it f√©in, gan bouncers, gan p√©as
An √°it lan c√≥cain, l√°n mn√°, l√°n gr√°, people we can entertain
Foc bouncers asking for your date of birth and your name

Bouncers, n√≠os measa n√° na p√©as
Bouncers, cos√∫il leis an S.S
Bouncers, n√≠os deise insan Kesh
Knocking me back agus wreckin' the sesh

Bouncers, n√≠os measa n√° na p√©as
Bouncers, cos√∫il leis an S.S
Bouncers, n√≠os deise insan Kesh
Knocking me back agus wreckin' the sesh

Cad √© an focain craic? An bhfuil na speakers ar an bhhealach?
T√° s√∫il agam gur ch√≠os t√∫ iad n√≠l mise chun iad a cheannach
DJ Pr√≥va√≠ ar na tunes, bangers go deo
Agus ullmhaidh muid na canna√≠ [?] daoine leo
Cur na soilse anseo, os comhair na decks
N√≠l aon focain dress code, cuir ort Nike Air Max
Caith aon r√∫d ar mhaith leat agus focain relax
Mar anocht n√≠ bheidh aon focain bouncers san √°it

Mar thosaigh muid ciorc√°il c√≥mhra
Idir na Mas agus na bouncers m√≥ra
Agus n√≠ nach ionadh go bhfuil daoine ag smaoineadh
An bhfaca m√© na dirty focain bouncers ag caoineadh?
Let it all out, mo chara's here for a cry
I‚Äôm only joking now imigh as mo radharc and die
Is cuma le Mo Chara, so foc faoi do chuid fadhbanna
Mar gheall ar na o√≠cheanta ar fhagadh m√© sna sr√°ideanna
[C√∫rfa]
Bouncers, n√≠os measa n√° na p√©as
Bouncers, cos√∫il leis an S.S
Bouncers, n√≠os deise insan Kesh
Knocking me back agus wreckin' the sesh

Bouncers, n√≠os measa n√° na p√©as
Bouncers, cos√∫il leis an S.S
Bouncers, n√≠os deise insan Kesh
Knocking me back agus wreckin' the sesh

B√≠ go deas, cneas(ta), ci√∫in ag iarraidh √°it a aimsi√∫
"Hello, kind sir, would you like Christ to find you?"
B√≠ muin√≠neach, cliste, gan aon rud a briseadh
Just √©ist go c√∫ramach, seo an d√≥igh √© a dh√©anadh
Coinnigh s√∫il g√©ar amach agus b√©idh t√∫ go brea
Agus coinnigh p√≠osa beag hash ar feadh teacht an Ra
Mar at√° i ngn√°th nuair a thagann siad gan a r√°
We say "fuck the Queen" agus "tiocfaidh √°r l√°"

[C√∫rfa]
Bouncers, n√≠os measa n√° na p√©as
Bouncers, cos√∫il leis an S.S
Bouncers, n√≠os deise insan Kesh
Knocking me back agus wreckin' the sesh
Bouncers, n√≠os measa n√° na p√©as
Bouncers, cos√∫il leis an S.S
Bouncers, n√≠os deise insan Kesh
Knocking me back agus wreckin' the sesh

Do rogha f√©in ar an bealach isteach
We got smoke, c√≥c, hash agus frosty jack
We got d√≠deain, even if you‚Äôre wrecked
Agus no focain bouncer ag cur stop leis an craic
We got milse√°in when your jaws flyin‚Äô it
We got uisce when you really feelin‚Äô it
We got a strict new policy guaranteed:
N√≠l f√°ilte roimh na Garda√≠

N√° √≠oc isteach and t√≥g iompair amach
And foc bouncers, n√° tabhair aon aitheantais leat
T√° s√© faoi smacht, it's self-policed anocht
Seo blais√≠n den muirtheas at√° le teacht
√ì Kneecap, tri√∫ir focain cheeky bastards
Your dad‚Äôs a disgrace and your life‚Äôs a disaster
C√° bhfuil do dheirfi√∫ir? An bhfuil achan rud casta?
Mar phl√©asc m√© go luath agus d‚Äôimigh m√© go gasta

[C√∫rfa]

They're only doin' their job, so they are")
