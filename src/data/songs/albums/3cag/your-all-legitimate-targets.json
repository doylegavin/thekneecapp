Your All Legitimate Targets Lyrics
[spoken]
A fheara is ar mhn√° na h√âireann
In the past few months, there has been an exponential rise in anti-social behaviours in our community
We've had numerous reports by concerned residents in regards to youths smoking marijuana, defecating on public walls, and off their heads on - quote - "m√°la√≠ m√≥ra ket"

Now, let this be a warning to all the drug dealers, purple heads, and wee shites, to stop immediately in all drug activity
(John, next time don't forget to mention our name
I know will ya fuck up)
We, the Radical Republicans Against Drugs, will no longer tolerate these parasites sucking the life out of our community with their excessive, hedonistic, toxic lifestyles
From today onward, anyone found taking drugs are legitimate targets, and anyone found selling narcotics will be brought forward to be kneecapped
