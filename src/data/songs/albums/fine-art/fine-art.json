Fine Art Lyrics
√âist liom, n√° tar chugam le do chuid smaoint√≠
N√° d√©an anail√≠s ar mo chuid l√≠nt√≠
My child loves HOOD so I wish you would do a version for him, but PG
Send me it when you can, he‚Äôs your number one fan
His first word‚Äôs were Cult√∫rlann so he understands all of 3CAG and
He only started Na√≠scoil an mh√≠ seo, he just thinks you guys are lethal
I know he‚Äôs a wee bit young, try to keep it from him, d√©anaimse mo dh√≠cheall
Comhghairdeas your my new ghost writer, 40 odd, breath smells like cider
Trying to talk business to me with jizz on your teeth, back of the glider!

KNEECAP, is bre√° liom sibh, nach bhfuil aon seans go dtiocfadh libh
Stick a wee tune out just for the kids cos my two ones they love you to bits
Oh fuck sake, wise up miss, w–µ‚Äôre degen–µrate HOODs who like to get pissed
And we spunk every penny getting off of our tits, this isn‚Äôt no act, it‚Äôs just the way it is, real shit

You‚Äôll find me in a snug of a dimly lit shit run down pub
Face all smug in a place I love, seeing how fucked I can get on government funds
That‚Äôs another pint done, ordaigh deoch sula labhrann cunt liom
And up walks some random standing over me rapping one of my songs

Maith an fear, seo here, is bre√° liom do cheol, nach dtiocfadh leat d√≠ri√∫ isteach ar an √≥l
An chaint seo ar fad ar na druga√≠ are bad, is t√° m√© a r√° leat n√≠ mharfaidh t√∫ i bhfad
Aw here go raibh maith agat do do chomhairle cr√≠onna
C√° raibh tusa nuair a thosaigh muid na blianta √≥ shin
No fuck, get a right to the chin and now you‚Äôre crying on twitter and that‚Äôs a win win

On the Nolan show today a mural of a burning police car and chants of get the brits out
This is Ireland 2022 rappers Kneecap say the mural was unveiled as just a piece of FINE ART

C-E-A-R-T-A, you say it needs more Tiocfaidh √°r L√°‚Äôs
Ag dul ar aghaidh faoi go bhfuil easpa collabs ag Kneecap, fuckin cuirig√≠ ceol amach!
So you‚Äôre wondering why we take ages to release music? We‚Äôre always on stages
All over in different places, rockin balaclavas on our faces

You can love us or hate us, won‚Äôt affect a bit of our wages
More merch, more drugs, less cops, more thugs, more scum, listen out on cases
You can love us or hate us, won‚Äôt affect a bit of our wages
More merch, more drugs, less cops, more thugs, more scum, more FINE ART
