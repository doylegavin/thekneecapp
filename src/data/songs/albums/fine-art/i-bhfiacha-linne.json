I bhFiacha Linne Lyrics
(‚ÄúAny cunt in this fucking pub owes me anything is getting fucking done‚Äù)

Aw fuck, hate cunts that don‚Äôt pay up
They make me do bad stuff
Try make me look like a city boy
Well fruit, I‚Äôm paying enough

Aw fuck, hate cunts that don‚Äôt pay up
They make me do bad stuff
Try make me look like a city boy
Well fruit, I‚Äôm paying enough

[Verse]
Is cuma liom c√© mh√©id at√° ann
[?], [?] or a couple of grand
Beag Beann, I‚Äôll be at the front door
There‚Äôs three shadows, you‚Äôll know what for
Cnag, that's a signature knock
Gimme two seconds while I blow off your chops
M√≥gla√≠ Bap is a vigorous chap
Mar t√° fiacla le f√°il and I'm scoping them out, wha
But their tills are fleeced
Spent your money on the kid last week, spoof
What you talking shit for? Can see a brand new
PS5 in th–µ corner
Anois, sin go leor de do haif√©alais(?)
Tim–µ to go, a lil Tarantino
A little green bag, switch blade and an ako
Mo Chara, Pr√≥va√≠, get the raincoats
See Kneecap Live
Get tickets as low as $81

[Chorus]
I bhfiacha linne
Caillfidh t√∫ do chuid bhfiacla
Stick their mouth down onto the pavement
‚Äògul do seo ann a bh√≠ [?]
3CAG, pop and drop you like jenga
(Kaboot, Sl√°n)
Cuairt f√° abairt[?] chuig do mham (hello)
Casleurs[?] tana√≠ i mo l√°mh
Fiacl√≥ir? No, no, (t√°) a bhfiacla glan

[Verse]
C√©n sl√°n le do [?] do chops getting fade
We shavin‚Äô a bit off the top, Kneecap
No longer the one-stop shop for pricks to profit off of our stock
Now I‚Äôve got some hippie by the fringe, the wee cunt makes me cringe
(‚Ä¶)

(Murder binge)
N√≠ g√° daoibh seo a dh√©anamh n√≠os deacra
T√°imid anseo do reeling [?] ar do shakra
An dtuigeann t√∫, dig her too
Strangle if I have to
Lips blue, your eyes bloodshot like a rasta
Mar is mise an teachtaire
Asphysixiate ye or chuir shot in ya
Beidh t√∫ ataithe
Mar t√° m√© cleactaithe
Ag c√©asadh na cunt seo ina bhfuil smachtaithe
[Chorus]
I bhfiacha linne
Caillfidh t√∫ do chuid bhfiacla
Stick their mouth down onto the pavement
‚Äògul do seo ann a bh√≠ [?]
3CAG, pop and drop you like jenga
(Kaboot, Sl√°n)
Cuairt f√° abairt[?] chuig do mham (hello)
Casleurs[?] tana√≠ i mo l√°mh
Fiacl√≥ir? No, no, (t√°) a bhfiacla glan

[Verse]
‚Äòis a deis see do mham like ‚Äòwha?‚Äô
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not a drug dealer, is aingil (√©) mo mhac
He's friends from the Shankhill, the top of the rock
He was constantly asking me for a top‚Äù
Do mh√°thair walked in shocked
N√≠ bheadh in√°r bhialann ar bith ag tabhairt amach
God love her, her son did suffer
Come next summer she‚Äôll still be paying your strap

Two boots to the door, t√°imid anois i do theach
Bainfeadh m√© Nike Air Max de do mhac
Your van and your toaster were taken, the lot
‚ÄúBut I need that for work because it‚Äôs all that I've got‚Äù
Aw fuck, fear bocht, wee stinge, down on his luck
An now he‚Äôs gurning ‚Äòcus Kneecap are taking all of his stuff
T√° do challa i mo mh√°la
Do telly bainte de do bhalla
's t√°imid ag glacadh, gafa, n√≠ fotagraifeanna
At√° croctha insan halla
Fuck it, we may take more
Lads yis are owed a score
‚Äòis t√° sibh ag f√°g√°il anocht le f√°il twenty quid
T√° seo ag dul thar f√≥ir
[Chorus]
I bhfiacha linne
Caillfidh t√∫ do chuid bhfiacla
Stick their mouth down onto the pavement
‚Äògul do seo ann a bh√≠ [?]
3CAG, pop and drop you like jenga
(Kaboot, Sl√°n)
Cuairt f√° abairt[?] chuig do mham (hello)
Casleurs[?] tana√≠ i mo l√°mh
Fiacl√≥ir? No, no, (t√°) a bhfiacla glan

[Chorus]
I bhfiacha linne
Caillfidh t√∫ do chuid bhfiacla
Stick their mouth down onto the pavement
‚Äògul do seo ann a bh√≠ [?]
3CAG, pop and drop you like jenga
(Kaboot, Sl√°n)
Cuairt f√° abairt[?] chuig do mham (hello)
Casleurs[?] tana√≠ i mo l√°mh
Fiacl√≥ir? No, no, (t√°) a bhfiacla glan

‚ÄúI bhfiacha linne‚Äù is a track explicitly referencing the no-nonsense lifestyle of drugdealers in areas of Belfast where drug-taking is rife; making references to the manner in which those who owe money are brutalised and stolen from, in spite of their dire situations.
