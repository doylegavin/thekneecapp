Love Making Lyrics
[Chorus]
You know, I know I‚Äôm the one your gonna be taking
From your show to your home, me and you lets be love making
Your hands do enough, it‚Äôs all about the way we‚Äôre syncing up, oh oh, oh oh

[Verse]
N√≠ amh√°in gn√©as ach craic, lets make a mess and relax
Cos we‚Äôve got vibes in stacks, local snacks and hotel sacks
F√©ilt√≠, b√©ilt√≠, filthy texts, chillin listening to silky tracks
Damhsa, bouncing in packs, tinneas poit, toit and we‚Äôre back
Ar shi√∫l linn go h√°it l√°n daoine, c√∫pla stout a few martinis
Is t√° t√∫ ar an eolas, laid back flawless, n√≠l leithsc√©al de dh√≠th to come see ye
Ar an leathanach c√©anna, i leabhar difri√∫il but I wouldn‚Äôt change ya
Gan srianta, you‚Äôre no saint ach n√≠l m√© f√©in ach an oiread, sinner le blianta

Faoi do gheasa, ag titim i ngr√° giota beag r√≥ghasta
An duin–µ deireanach i gc√≥na√≠ ag an afters
Piolla ina l√°mh sh–µ knows gan dabht we‚Äôre gonna go halfers
Fi√°in chan classy, is ar √©igean go bhf√°gaimid an leabaidh
Tuigeann s√≠ go maith go bhfuair m√© mo sh√°ith de na quantity birds
Seo bean ar leith

[Chorus]
You know, I know I‚Äôm the one your gonna be taking
From your show to your home, me and you lets be love making
Your hands do enough, it‚Äôs all about the way we‚Äôre syncing up, oh oh, oh oh

[Verse]
Aimsir go dona lasmuigh so it‚Äôs tine lasta ag freastal uirthi
She‚Äôs a rascal indeed and it‚Äôs class all for me
Then she laughs said she‚Äôs sponsored a rapper in need
R√©ch√∫iseach, fuinneamh calm, beo sa bhomaite bu√≠och de m‚Äôam
Ag f√°il c√≥ngarach whenever I can, cos she says I do enough with my hands

T√° m√© gafa le do pheromones, I‚Äôm grabbin her hair she‚Äôs doin mad moans
Pit √≥ na flaithis agus t√≥in mh√≥r ramhar, is thiocfadh linn caint go deo faoi aon √°bhar
You know I know, we‚Äôre trying to take it slow, but I‚Äôm onstage looking at the front row
You‚Äôre all I see and you‚Äôre looking at me, I can see it in your eyes let‚Äôs split let‚Äôs leave

[Chorus]
You know, I know I‚Äôm the one your gonna be taking
From your show to your home, me and you lets be love making
Your hands do enough, it‚Äôs all about the way we‚Äôre syncing up, oh oh, oh oh
