I‚Äôm Flush Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I'm flush
Sceitim√≠n√≠ ag teacht ormsa le gach cois-
C√©im, t√©amsa 'uig an pub
No fuss when I jump in a taxi, not on a bus
Pure zen 'cause you know I got paid, let's spend
Gach pingin at√° agam
Henry VIII in my pocket, I'm fuckin' dishin' out lovin'
N√≠ hionnann sin a r√°, I'm your mate ach go tobann
I'm surrounded by coke fiends asking if I've got something

[Chorus]
It's not all about the money
But I'm fuckin' flush, now I find it kinda funny
Couple of quid, my rainy day's turned sunny
Packet in my pocket, my nose goes runny
So fuck, it's not all about the cheddar
Now that I've got it, my night looks better
Smile on my face since the first day that I met her
Colombian cold when I'm feelin' under the weather
No, fuck, it's 'cause I'm sniffin' loads of banger

[Verse 2]
I'm stuffed, mo bh√©al a l√°n oisr√≠ le Tabasco sauce
I'm lyin' in bed till late, 'cause I have't got a boss
I'm spending all my money, no matter 'bout the cost
Once second-hand Lacoste, now it's Gucci and Balenciaga
N√≠l m√© ag iarraidh bheith chomh bocht le mo hathair
That's not what I'm after
Looking something more I've never had before
Won't see me walking the street
Unless there's TNs on my feet and they're sweet
Neat and clean
Was always stardawg, now it's only cali green
Leis an caighde√°n is fearr f√≠on, chandelier ar mo dh√≠on
I'm a working-class fella with a middle-class palate
Yes, sir, that's me
We went from rags to riches
And we got a wee machine that be cleaning our dishes
And we be going on missions, stayin' up late in the kitchens
Everybody fuckin' talks, but nobody listens
See Kneecap Live
Get tickets as low as $81

It's not all about the money
But I'm fuckin' flush, now I find it kinda funny
Couple of quid, my rainy day's turned sunny
Packet in my pocket, my nose goes runny
So fuck, it's not all about the cheddar
Now that I've got it, my night looks better
Smile on my face since the first day that I met her
Colombian cold when I'm feelin' under the weather
No, fuck, it's 'cause I'm sniffin' loads of banger

[Verse 3]
Si√∫il isteach, scum under one roof
Nightmare for the doorstaff
Live, laugh, look at West Belfast crew in for the big Baku
Mo poca√≠ l√°n le plean le h√© a chaitheamh
20 stout, ag scairt√≠ thar a ch√©ile until we're fucked out
Gan smeacht againn ar √°r ngialla communicate through shout
Looks like we're running out
Somebody send a taxi if the dealer's about

[Chorus]
It's not all about the money
But I'm fuckin' flush, now I find it kinda funny
Couple of quid, my rainy day's turned sunny
Packet in my pocket, my nose goes runny
So fuck, it's not all about the cheddar
Now that I've got it, my night looks better
Smile on my face since the first day that I met her
Colombian cold when I'm feelin' under the weather
No, fuck, it's 'cause I'm sniffin' loads of banger
