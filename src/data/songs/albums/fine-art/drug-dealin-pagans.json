[Verse 1]
B√≠mse ag crochadh thart le Druids
Powder paraphernalia and fluids
Tine cn√°mha, amharc suas
Ar an Ghealach, is d√©an fuaim
Drug dealing pagans
Human sacrifice to become famous
N√≠ bheidh muid ag dul where the pearly gate is
A priest would have us locked up and sedated
'Cause ye can't save us

Le linn blianta fada mh√≥r an chogaidh
√ì Iarthar Bheal Feirste siar go Taobh an Bhogaidh
N√≠ ghlacann s√© I bhfad sula mbuaileann t√∫ le Chucky
Blaring rebs doing a half, caitheamh siar buid√©al Bucky
N√≠ dh√©anaim aon rud nach bhfuil m√© ag iarraidh a dh√©anamh
Airgead m√≥r m√° t√∫ lorg m√© le canadh
Tabharfaidh mise aire de do mhama√≠, do leanbh
Isteach an doras tosaigh mar is cuma faoi do bheann√∫

[Chorus: Manch√°n Magan]
F√©ach, f√©ach, nach bhfeiceann t√∫ √©?
Scaoil saor l–µ do ghualainn is glac an√°il mh√≥r tr√≠d do shr√≥n
T√° muid beo!
You don't know what's going on, nobody knows what's going on, fuck it!
S√≠lim go gcaithfidh m√© d√∫id, mar n√≠l aon rud n√≠os deise n√° f–µar ar an bhfli√∫t

[Verse 2]
Ag su√≠ anseo le Manch√°n le c√∫pla magnum
N√≠ ghlacann s√© I bhfad sula dt√©ann siad chuig do chloigeann
Aeroplane mode cos there's nothing to be checkin'
Ag iarraidh bheith beo f√° choinne achan uile shoicind
An comhr√° ag √©ir√≠ domhain agus snaois dul suas mo shr√≥n
You can't buy time, you can only get a loan
Ach n√° b√≠ faoi bhr√≥n it's a softboy-free zone
T√° rud √©igin sa sp√©ir cos we're never alone

Nach deas a bheith beo
Ag moth√∫ an fhuacht, ag si√∫l fr√≠d an cheo
Maidin luath o√≠che mhall gan str√≥
Mo shaol gan treo
I came I saw, I gazed in awe
Chonaic m√© an √°illeacht
T√° eolas ar f√°il ansin duit m√°s maith leat
Cruinnigh √©, ya mad cunt, sure, why not?
You'll end up with a brain as big as I've got

[Chorus: Manch√°n Magan]
F√©ach, f√©ach, nach bhfeiceann t√∫ √©?
Scaoil saor le do ghualainn is glac an√°il mh√≥r tr√≠d do shr√≥n
T√° muid beo!
You don't know what's going on, nobody knows what's going on, fuck it!
S√≠lim go gcaithfidh m√© d√∫id, mar n√≠l aon rud n√≠os deise n√° fear ar an bhfli√∫t
[Outro: Manch√°n Magan]
Ah bhaineas ana-
Bhaineas ana thaitneamh as sin
Like, you know, you don't know what's going on
Nobody knows what's going on
Fuck it
S√≠lim go gcaithfidh m√© d√∫id m√≥r beatha√≠och ramhar, aww
Caithfidh muid, mar n√≠ thuigeann √©inne an cac a dtuigimse
Beidh m√© ar st√°itse libh
Beidh m√© fuckin' ‚Äì what's it? ‚Äì belly, not belly dancing
Crowd surfing, sin √©
Gone, le mo ch√≠ocha amuigh ar foluain go mortasach

Along with Kneecap, this song features Manch√°n Magan playing the role of a Druid. A prolific writer as well as a documentary television producer, Magan has worked extensively on projects benefiting the awareness and use of the Irish language, with books documenting hyper-specific Irish words that have no facile English translation, such as his tome 32 Words For Field.

His commitment to ‚ÄúAn Teanga‚Äù is such, that perhaps no one, not even Kneecap, has done more for the revitalization of the Irish language than Manch√°n, who comes from a long line of Irish radicals, going back to his great-grand-uncle The O'Rahilly.

In addition to his academic pursuits, he is also a musician, and has even covered a Kneecap song while he was on a book tour in Chicago.
