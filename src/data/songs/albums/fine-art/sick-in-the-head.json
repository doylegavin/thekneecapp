Sick In The Head Lyrics
Chorus:
I‚Äôve got a point to be proving to myself, sitting too long getting mouldy on the shelf
Cos I‚Äôm too far gone when it comes to mental health
Rather be sick in the head with a little bit of wealth
T√° m√© tinn de bheith ag glacadh comhairle str√°ins√©ara
Mar t√° an cinneadh a dh√©anann daoine domsa d√°ins√©arach
Ag √©ir√≠ leadr√°nach, go s√≠ora√≠ ag caint cac‚Äô
N√≠l m√© dul a bheith ag √©isteacht as seo amach

Seasaig√≠, t√∫ ar do ghl√∫ine they‚Äôre doing it to ya constantly
An individual is surely what ya want to be, you‚Äôre born to stand out
Live your fantasy before they eat you up and spit you out and laugh at ye
Fan socair, b√≠ d√≠ograiseach is clo√≠gh le do phlean mucker
There‚Äôll be push backs but relax siocair, gur seo do thriailse
Do shaol at√° ann brother
It‚Äôs a philosophy

N√≠ ligim don domhan m√≥r riamh dul i bhfeidhm ar an fh√≠orshaol at√° ar an taobh istigh
To be affecting me because cib√© rud at√° le tarl√∫ is always how it‚Äôs meant to be
So goitse, cogar, clo√≠gh leat f√©in is n√° h√©ist le haon fucker
N√≠ thuigeann siad tusa mar a thuigeann tusa tusa, n√≠or shi√∫il siad i do chosa
So t√≥g seans, seans go n-√©ireoidh s√© n√≠os fusa

Chorus:
I‚Äôve got a point to be proving to myself, sitting too long getting mouldy on the shelf
Cos I‚Äôm too far gone when it comes to mental health
Rather be sick in the head with a little bit of wealth
T√° m√© tinn de bheith ag glacadh comhairle str√°ins√©ara
Mar t√° an cinneadh a dh√©anann daoine domsa d√°ins√©arach
Ag √©ir√≠ leadr√°nach, go s√≠ora√≠ ag caint cac‚Äô
N√≠l m√© dul a bheith ag √©isteacht as seo amach

I prayed to the devil, let me be rich instead, he said
‚ÄúYou‚Äôll no longer be skint but you‚Äôll be sick in the head
N√≠ bheidh t√∫ riamh sna sr√°ideanna ach agatsa, beidh fadhbanna
You want this for n√°ideanna sa bhreis when you‚Äôre paid?‚Äù
Yes!

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a mad cunt Mo Chara‚Äù

Sound! I‚Äôll be back for a fat loan tomorrow, that‚Äôs me never getting dressed
Depressed and always para, throwing tantrums in my mansion, am I embarrassed?
Nah

Gach seans go bhfuil m√© giota beag ar mire, n√≠l aon dabht maidir liomsa is Mo Chara
Ar strae insa cheann, when we‚Äôre smoking then we‚Äôre smoking til it‚Äôs all done all gone
No half measures til it‚Äôs aw naw
But we‚Äôre making up our own laws, never getting worried bout our own flaws
Fuck a real job, we make our own bob, KNEECAP 3CAG we‚Äôre our own Gods

Chorus:
I‚Äôve got a point to be proving to myself, sitting too long getting mouldy on the shelf
Cos I‚Äôm too far gone when it comes to mental health
Rather be sick in the head with a little bit of wealth
T√° m√© tinn de bheith ag glacadh comhairle str√°ins√©ara
Mar t√° an cinneadh a dh√©anann daoine domsa d√°ins√©arach
Ag √©ir√≠ leadr√°nach, go s√≠ora√≠ ag caint cac‚Äô
N√≠l m√© dul a bheith ag √©isteacht as seo amach

We‚Äôre in the centre of a sweaty mosh pit mid-gig in a dark warehouse room. This pit represents emotional state, from f*cked up and chaotic to moments of clarity and calmness. The warehouse offers escape ‚Äì from the mundane‚Ä¶ for the marginalised.
