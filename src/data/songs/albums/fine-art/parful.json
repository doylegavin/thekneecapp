Parful Lyrics
Well, this wall was built years ago
To stop the Protestants on this side fighting with the Catholics on the other
It's there 24 hours a day
The thing is that it divides the two communities
But every Saturday night hundreds of people go out down town, just go out clubbin'
Forget about the divides between each other

[Mo Chara]
Parful
Crochadh thart in a bar full
Got mo snaois all wrapped in a parcel
Cos ya know that I get a bit partial
Mearbhall orm but I still feel parful
[M√≥gla√≠ Bap]
Gettin' whacked in the rain is parful
Chain smokin' with your mates is parful
Arrivin' late to rave with an eighth and your jawbone aches and ya still feel parful

They love every minut–µ of the time they'r–µ out with... no matter who they're with

Crochadh thart in a bar full
Got mo snaois all wrapped in a parcel
Cos ya know that I get a bit partial
Mearbhall orm but I still feel parful
[M√≥gla√≠ Bap]
Gettin' whacked in the rain is parful
Chain smokin' with your mates is parful
Arrivin' late to rave with an eighth and your jawbone aches and ya still feel parful

These young people have lived their entire lives in a society poisoned by sectarian hatred
Now they're telling us the rave brings protestants and Catholics together
