Rhino Ket Lyrics
[M√≥gla√≠ Bap]
Need a come down after that set
This hamster shit is really not it
Wanna be stuck‚ÄÖto‚ÄÖthe ground with‚ÄÖa sniff
Instead I'm sitting here sober‚ÄÖlike a dick
Cause recently I heard a secret
There's this thing called rhinoceros ket
When you take a line it makes you forget (Sounds great)
Bally up and let's rob a vet (Sweet)

[Mo Chara]
Sin a gig d√©anta
M√≥gla√≠ ag caint ar Rhino Ket, you know I want that
So we hatched a plan t√°imid santach
Christmas comin' early in the bed of Santa
So it's c√©al d√≠reach chuig an clinic, pure ket, fuck all else in it
Scale the counter, we only have a minute
L√©igh na lip√©id√≠, find it and bring it
Back to the Falls Road
But before we leave, a bit for the walk home
T√≥g eochair stuff i do mo shr√≥n
[?]

Can somebody call Prova√≠ to make another drug deal
Been sniffing this shit all night, I'm sober as a judge and it's just not right
See Kneecap Live
Get tickets as low as $81

[M√≥gla√≠ Bap & Mo Chara]
I'm getting nothing off this
Uh, M√≥gla√≠, honestly just wait, wait
Oh fuck, I can't see
I'm getting nothing off this!
M√≥gla√≠, M√≥gla√≠! I can't see!
Lucky, lucky bastard!
What the fuck did you do, I can't see!
No!

[M√≥gla√≠ Bap]
Can't sit, can't think, can barely even walk
Don't know how the fuck we'll make it back to Falls
Trying to stick these but my hands have turned to paws
Oh lord, think I took it too far
[?]

[Mo Chara]
The best, maith and fear, M√≥gla√≠, all the best
Keep your clothes on, can't be getting undressed
N√≠os m√≥ capall√≠, probably
Giddy up, rack it up, get me fucked
Check my pulse whenever I'm interdimensional traveling

Holy fucking shit, it's lethal
Fuck me, how am I gonna get my eyesight back now?
Jesus Christ, that was enough to kill a small fucking village
[Both]
I'm k-holed out my head, this shit puts rhinos to bed
I'm k-holed out my head, this shit puts rhinos to bed
I'm k-holed out my head, this shit puts rhinos to bed
I'm k-holed out my head, this shit puts rhinos to bed

I'm k-holed out my head, this shit puts rhinos to bed
I'm k-holed out my head, this shit puts rhinos to bed
I'm k-holed out my head, this shit puts rhinos to bed
I'm k-holed out my head, this shit puts rhinos to bed
