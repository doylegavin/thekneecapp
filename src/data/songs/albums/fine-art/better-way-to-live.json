Better Way to Live Lyrics
[Chorus - Grian Chatten]
Underneath all the thundering there's magic
And if there's a better way to live, I've gotta have it
Because I think all day, but when I drink I'm okay
It gets further away, every time I try and grab it
Underneath all the chattering there‚Äôs heaven
I got a little peek one day, made me feel like I was 7
I know it exists, but I can't stop getting pissed
One more thing I'll be adding to the list

[Verse 1 - Mo Chara]
Faoi dheireadh t√° deireadh tagtha le mo rut
Mar bh√≠ l√° maith agamsa inniu bu√≠ochas le foc
So I stroll I dtreo an pholl sa bhalla
4 digit code, what do you know its Mo Chara
And I'm gonna be spending my dole tonight
Two pints at a time strolling about like Dolemite
But home for a shite ar dt√∫s, thit s√© amach one push
Mar nach raibh bac ar bith ag baili√∫ strap inniu, seo M√≥gla√≠ Bap
(what's happening)
And then we both jump down and do a class handstand
Like a man's man can
F√°g sl√°n leis an d√∫shl√°n a bh√≠ againn an mh√≠ seo
Mar go dt√≠ seo, I'm on the upside of the sea-saw

[Chorus - Grian Chatten]
Underneath all the thundering there's magic
And if there's a better way to live, I've gotta have it
Because I think all day, but when I drink I'm okay
It gets further away, every time I try and grab it
Underneath all the chattering there‚Äôs heaven
I got a little peek one day, made me feel like I was 7
I know it exists, but I can't stop getting pissed
One more thing I'll be adding to the list

[Verse 2 - M√≥gla√≠ Bap]
Go f√≥ill ag moth√∫ cos√∫il le cac
Ach n√≠ ligim orm f√©in cause an nd√©anann s√© stop?
Obviously not, what? Is mise Moglai Bap
Cuirim mo raybans orm sula bhf√°gaim an teach
N√≥ ba chuma liom, cause t√° an t-am ag dul anonn
Is t√° an saol seo I bhfad r√≥ghairid bheith ag cur am√∫ an oiread ama ann
Go s√≠ora√≠ i do cheann ag iarraidh √©al√∫ achan soicind
Irish exit out the back without text
Mar caithfidh t√∫ t√∫ f√©in a chur chun tosaigh
I bhfad r√≥fhurast bheith chomh crua ort f√©in i gc√≥na√≠
Mar n√≠ haon √°it bheith i‚Äôdo ch√≥na√≠, d√©an cib√© rud dtig leat a st√≥caigh
Is faigh f√≠or-bhlas sula n-im√≠onn an beocht di

[Chorus - Grian Chatten]
Underneath all the thundering there's magic
And if there's a better way to live, I've gotta have it
Because I think all day, but when I drink I'm okay
It gets further away, every time I try and grab it
Underneath all the chattering there‚Äôs heaven
I got a little peek one day, made me feel like I was 7
I know it exists, but I can't stop getting pissed
One more thing I'll be adding to the list

[Verse 3 - Mo Chara]
Imigh as do cheann
Caith do chloigeann in airde
Ar barr na [donn?], thuigimse go bhfuil an saol trom
Is tionchar ann, but we got one chance at, then it's done
So b√≠ th√∫ fh√©in, speak your pain, and receive the love
Don't let the cunts get ya
Down, surround yourself with ones that miss ya
T√≥g soicind, t√≥g anall, nach go [m√≠ sciste?]
Is creid go daingean go bhfuil an saol seo duitse
[Chorus - Grian Chatten]
Underneath all the thundering there's magic
And if there's a better way to live, I've gotta have it
Because I think all day, but when I drink I'm okay
It gets further away, every time I try and grab it
Underneath all the chattering there‚Äôs heaven
I got a little peek one day, made me feel like I was 7
I know it exists, but I can't stop getting pissed
One more thing I'll be adding to the list

KNEECAP:

‚ÄòA Better Way To Live‚Äô is all about finding that little spark of joy in the monotony, in the day-to-day things that you barely bat an eye at. In between the moments of that repetitive lift of the pint, or spark of a cigarette, there is an opportunity for bliss. underneath that constant noise, there is a silence that can breathe new life and inspiration breaking through the mundane.
