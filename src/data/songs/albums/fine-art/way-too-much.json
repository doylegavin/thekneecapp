Way Too Much Lyrics
When things get way too much
Get way too much

[Móglaí Bap verse]
Nuair a éirím ó mo leabaidh tá mé gléasta
Réidh fá choinne cibé rud 'tá I gceist le
I bhfad rómhinic mhúscail mise is mé céasta
Ach anois osclaím mo shúil is tá mé réidh fá choinne aon rud
Live, laugh, love
Used to feel nothin' till I took some drugs
Now I run about just feelin' pure smug
Cos I made it out the ruts
Not to say I feel good, but I feel nasc more than I ever could

[Mo Chara verse]
Achan uile rud ag bogadh róghasta
So tógaim céim siar whenever I haveta
Started to substitute stress out for laughter
Get myself in check, relax and come back after
Furasta bheith faoi smacht ag freagracht
Snowed under when you've stuff ya can't clock
The show must go on, some things ya can't stop
Scaifte anseo le tú a fheiceáil, make them laugh, pal

[Chorus]
When things get way too much
You gotta give me a touch, one, two
Just know it'll never be enough
Gotta get out your head, boy
Before you know it you'll be dead, gone
But I can't keep you off my mind

[Mo Chara verse]
Bíonn laethanta mar sin againn ar fad
Rud I ndiaidh ruda, chin up, brother, it's grand
When it seems that it's comin' gan stad
Puff your chest out, lad, and remember who's the man
Roinnt amanntaí agaigh chróga
Réiteach eile, tá sé go breá a bheith brónach
Take the olive branch, I'm sure you know that
Just get through this mornin', bain triail arís tráthnóna

[Móglaí Bap verse]
Seachas féin-chrá, cad é faoi fhéin-ghrá
Seachas bheith ag tabhairt amach duit féin gach lá
Glac sos lig scíth, goid píos ó do chíste
Luigh sa leabaidh níl muid anseo ach fá choinne píosa
Is beag lá nach bhfuil tú ar m'intinn
Is beag comhrá nach bhfaigheann tusa mention
Faraor géar ní fhaighimid extension
So take your time with the shit you be ingestin'
So fill your cup
And don't be lettin' no cunt take away your buzz with every single sup
Cos that's the way it is
Doesn't mean it always was
But I'm grateful to fuck for these class A drugs

When things get way too much
You gotta give me a touch, one, two
Just know it'll never be enough
Gotta get out your head, boy
Before you know it you'll be dead and gone
But I can't keep you off my-
When things get way too much
You gotta give me a touch, one, two
Just know it'll never be enough
Gotta get out your head, boy
Before you know it you'll be dead and gone
But I can't keep you off my mind

When things get way too much
You gotta give me a touch, one, two
Just know it'll never be enough
Gotta get out your head, boy
Before you know it you'll be dead, gone
But I can't keep you off my mind
