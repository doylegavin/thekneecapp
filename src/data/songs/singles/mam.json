Mam Lyrics
[Mogla√≠ Bap]
Gr√° mo chro√≠, mo mhama√≠, c√© go raibh m√© cine√°l scanraithe
Nuair a th√°inig s√≠ abhaile ‚Äòs an teach go hioml√°n salach
N√≠l m√© ag iarraidh tabhairt amach, no, n√≠l m√© ag iarraidh troid anocht lad
T√° an cheann seo duitse, mo mhama√≠ cliste

Pasta pesto, pr√°ta√≠ r√≥sta, teach go hioml√°n focain reoite
Saoire fada ar an ch√≥sta ‚Äòs cleachtadh ceol, I nearly lost it
N√≠l m√© ag iarraidh tabhairt amach, no, n√≠l m√© ag iarraidh troid anocht lad
T√° an cheann seo duitse, mo mhama√≠ cliste

'Cause n√≠l faic n√≠os crua de na single mas
She‚Äôd knock the cunt out of any da, she‚Äôd break a jaw
D√° mbeadh an g√°, she‚Äôd go berzerk gan any f√°th
Like, "n√≠or ghlan t√∫ an focain leithreas i gceart, ye wee focan shite"
Foc, that‚Äôs me gettin‚Äô bate again tonight, and then Dyrt goes...

[DYRT]
Thank fuck mam's don‚Äôt do a runn–µr
'Cause some dads spend y–µars buying butter
I just took another line with my brother
So I want to tell my mam that I love her

[Curf√°]
Seo ceann do na mn√°, a bh√≠onn ag obair gach l√°
Ag cur iad f√©in i mbaol, oh, ar mhaithe len√°r saoil
Seo ceann do mo mhama√≠, gan th√∫ bheinn tana√≠
Gan th√∫ bheinn a bana√≠, oh is gr√° liom th√∫ a mama√≠...

[DYRT]
My father's child, my mother's son
That line can be troublesome
Ah sure, what's done is done
And my mother is a stubborn cunt
For a son, no needed assistance
'Twas Breda and Vincent 'til he flew off and left me in Breda's hands
'Cause my father had Peter Pan syndrome symptoms
But I don't begrudge you Vince
I'm sure that you loved your kids
You just weren't able to be there enough because of trauma you suffer with, but fuck it, it's
All in the past, it's all in the bag I haul on my back
And never complained, it brought me the knack of knowing how trauma impacts
Kids are whacked-out without thought for their mam when she's giving them all that she can
Trapped in their self-centered thoughts about all that they lack because they're missing a bond with their dad
But she played dad when the job was his, so I want to say thanks for all you did
Every cloud, as they say, the problem is
That's just another line that I'll probably sniff

[Curf√°]
Seo ceann do na mn√°, a bh√≠onn ag obair gach l√°
Ag cur iad f√©in i mbaol, oh, ar mhaithe len√°r saoil
Seo ceann do mo mhama√≠, gan th√∫ bheinn tana√≠
Gan th√∫ bheinn a bana√≠, oh is gr√° liom th√∫ a mama√≠...

[Mo Chara]
Is gr√° liom th√∫ mama√≠, a mhama√≠, ye had me eating shite dinners like spuds and salami
Ach is cuimhin liom go minic bheadh braill√≠n √∫r nuair a thiocfas m√© abhaile ar mo leaba√≠
Ar bith ar m√© ag spraoi, since I fell out your gee
N√≠ minic a bhfeicfinn t√∫ i do shu√≠
Mo mhama√≠, mo laoch, t√°im bu√≠och duit mar bh√≠
I gc√≥na√≠ bia ar mo phl√°ta, calling me do wee ghr√°sa
And you never went mad, whenever I had a c√≥isir i do theach
Is m√≥ an bhu√≠ochas leatsa, mo mh√°thair cro√≠√∫il snasta
As mo bheatha, cuimhn√≠ s√°sta, and slapping me when you had to
[DYRT]
So thank fuck mam's don‚Äôt do a runner
'Cause some dads spend years buying butter
I just took another line with my brother
So I want to tell my mam that I love her

[Curf√°]
Seo ceann do na mn√°, a bh√≠onn ag obair gach l√°
Ag cur iad f√©in i mbaol, oh, ar mhaithe len√°r saoil
Seo ceann do mo mhama√≠, gan th√∫ bheinn tana√≠
Gan th√∫ bheinn a bana√≠, oh is gr√° liom th√∫ a mama√≠...

Seo ceann do na mn√°, a bh√≠onn ag obair gach l√°
Ag cur iad f√©in i mbaol, oh, ar mhaithe len√°r saoil
Seo ceann do mo mhama√≠, gan th√∫ bheinn tana√≠
Gan th√∫ bheinn a bana√≠, oh is gr√° liom th√∫ a mama√≠...

MAM a powerful and emotional tribute to mothers, blending raw vulnerability with the group‚Äôs signature lyrical depth. Written before the devastating loss of bandmember M√≥gla√≠ Bap‚Äôs mother to suicide, the song carries an intimate weight, offering both love and remembrance.

The track showcases Kneecap‚Äôs ability to balance heartfelt storytelling with a universal message, touching on themes of family, grief, and resilience. With all proceeds going to Samaritans, the song not only honors their mothers but also aims to raise awareness and support for mental health.

For our latest project with DYRT we wanted to create one song that‚Äôs a bit different from the usual.
So we decided to do a tune about somethin real, our Mothers.
I was really looking forward to lettin Mam hear the tune but i told her she‚Äôd have to wait til it‚Äôs done, I wanted it to be perfect for her.
Unfortunately, i lost my mother recently to suicide and it broke my heart that she never got to hear it.
Keep and eye out for eachother especially over crimbo üíö
We‚Äôre going to have the single on sale next week to raise money for Samaritans charity
If anyone ever needs a chat send us a message Ns.
Mam, taÃÅ an ceann seo duitse.
