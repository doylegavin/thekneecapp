It‚Äôs Been Ages Lyrics
[C√∫rfa - Mowgli Bap]
Oh it's been ages, since we made the front pages
Sin deireadh linn ar hiatus
Back to annoy 'em cunts that hate us

It's back to basics, a scumbag hood I'm shameless
Take more than that to tame us
All your fault cause you made us famous

[V√©arsa 1 - Mowgli Bap]
All your fault cause you made us famous
Sticking our face in your papers
But we got love by our neighbours
You keep track when you're giving favours
Sad
Cuir i gc√©ill go bhfuil tu deas
I do shuigh i do ph√°l√°s
Ach t√©imid ar fad i do phl√°m√°s

T√©imid ar fad i do phl√°m√°s
Achan uile rud ar shon do leas
N√≠os mo votai sin do tasc
Ag ceangail ruda√≠ nach bhfuil nasc...
Ann. Call [?] your face and then you're scum
That's enough for the story that'll run
Sensational headline, that's job done

[V√©arsa 2 - Mo Chara]
Fuck me it's been ages, since my mick–µy was contagious
So you thought the Kneecap craze was over, w–µ're back
Keeping diabetic politicians raging
Been a while since cunts were blaming
Kneecap, no ranting no raving
It's been no naming or shaming
T√°imid ar ais, your career we're saving

Naomi Long, do you need another epidural?
All cause we unveiled a mural
Ach Mo Chara, why so cruel?
Cause it's been ages, God bless us and save us
Back with a bang and it feels amazing
Going nowhere or going places

[C√∫rfa - Mowgli Bap]
Oh it's been ages, since we made the front pages
Sin deireadh linn ar hiatus
Back to annoy 'em cunts that hate us

It's back to basics, a scumbag hood I'm shameless
Take more than that to tame us
All your fault cause you made us famous

[V√©arsa 3 - Mo Chara]
Is fada an l√°, √≥ a bh√≠ muid de do chr√°
New centerpiece Telegraph
Did you miss us, are you glad?
Go bhfuil muid ar ais le plean
Bh√≠ sos againn, its been class
Ach anois √≥ seo amach is linn an buacht
Gach l√° ar an nuacht, bolscaireacht
Propaganda machine
Kneecap back all over your screens
Drochmheas √≥ mar a bh√≠
Ach i bhfad n√≠os measa, wait and see
Cause it's been ages
Controversy won't phase us
We hold all the cards and they're aces
Try to protect your kids but they'll hear us

[V√©arsa 4 - Mowgli Bap]
[?] do mham√≥ faoina √°it ag an tabla
Goid√© a ch√≠m [?] ceangailte le c√°bla
A c√∫l [?] bhean ban, le tri√∫r fear ann i mbalaclava
Goid√© a tharla√≠onn ansin

P√≠osa fada maith a de√°nfaidh muid as radharc
But I want to be back in the Sunday World
So I smack that cunt with the back of my hurl
(Stick that in your paper)

[C√∫rfa - Mowgli Bap]
Oh it's been ages, since we made the front pages
Sin deireadh linn ar hiatus
Back to annoy 'em cunts that hate us

It's back to basics, a scumbag hood I'm shameless
Take more than that to tame us
All your fault cause you made us famous
