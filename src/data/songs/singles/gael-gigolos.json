Gael-Gigolos Lyrics
On behalf of the official Republican movement
I'm here to tell you's, ya have twenty-four hours

Cunts, ag cur am√∫ mo chuid ama
Buachaill√≠ beaga d√°na
Sa t√≥ir orainn cheana
Tinn tuirseach of fake pr√≥va√≠s
Ach gheobhaidh siad faic uaim agus M√≥gla√≠
[M√≥gla√≠ Bap]
I told ye, nach b√≠ ag dul thar f√≥ir
Agus na b√≠ ag si√∫l thart cl√∫daithe in focain √≥ir
Look n√≠ ga a bheith buartha a st√≥r
It‚Äôs not like making a few quid was hard before
Bhuel t√° sin f√≠or, ach t√° na cunts seo gan ciall
Mar cuirfeadh muid deireadh lena fucking saol, s√≥isialta
And if you don‚Äôt know, I‚ÄôM NOT TELLING YE MUCKER
Alright then Mo Chara caide an f√≥cain plean
I‚Äôm fucking chocking out agus t√° muid ag ritheadh amach as am
Agus r√≥imhe bhfad bheadh √°r ngl√∫ine lan luaidhe
Fuck that t√° muid ag bogadh amach faoin tuath
Sure we‚Äôre well known for being cro√≠ na f√©ile
Just √∫s√°id do cheann agus tiocfaidh plean le cheile
Ag labhairt faoin ceann at√° ar do bhod
Mar t√° sean folk amuigh ansin ag iarraigh cuid
What are you looking? Gram for thirty, two for fifty

Na cunts, ag cur am√∫ mo chuid ama
Na blunts, n√≠l faic i mo mh√°la
Na funds, t√° seo ag iarraidh c√°sta
Ach ar an laghad t√° do mham√≥ s√°sta

Na cunts, ag cur am√∫ mo chuid ama
Na blunts, n√≠l faic i mo mh√°la
Na funds, t√° seo ag iarraidh c√°sta
Ach ar an laghad t√° do mham√≥ s√°sta

We made a mint off the baggies i gConnamara
Bheadh siad ag s√∫il le airgead maid√≠n am√°rach
Isteach liom ins an local siopa dara l√°imhe
Then selling clothes on to hipsters at halla na cathrach
Next up ag bualadh isteach ag cupla bean an t√≠
A locally known gigolo if your husband is deceased
[?]
Mar is sean fear t√∫ t√° m√© i bhfad n√≠os costasa√≠

Old Dick? I just lick it and spit
Sean fitch? Mate for airgead I eat that shit
Ach VIT-HIT r√≥imhe agus direach ina ndiaidh
Because hydrated boys can last all day

Codhladh orm I‚Äôm kicking up a storm
Le mo buaitais√≠ ghoirm mar n√≠ bheadh s√© tirim
Chead stop chuig an teach altranais
Yes Miss, Twenty extra for a tongue with a kiss
Agus caoga eile I‚Äôll let you slip the fist
Seo an saol anois
Kneecap ar an hit list
Gael-Gigolos, ag freast√°il ar na mammy hoes, na daddy hoes
Mar t√° m√© chomh bocht le mo serotonin
But even seandaoine need to get a boning
Daoine deasa when you get to know them
Na ruda√≠ deasa that could be stolen
‚ÄòNois n√≠l m√© ach magadh nuair a deirim √© sin
Na cur mo ainm s√≠os for your next of kin
Agus fagadh amach gach pinn do do pinsean
Abair le do chairde about my erection
Massive, Massive
Na cunts, ag cur am√∫ mo chuid ama
Na blunts, n√≠l faic i mo mh√°la
Na funds, t√° seo ag iarraidh c√°sta
Ach ar an laghad t√° do mham√≥ s√°sta

Na cunts, ag cur am√∫ mo chuid ama
Na blunts, n√≠l faic i mo mh√°la
Na funds, t√° seo ag iarraidh c√°sta
Ach ar an laghad t√° do mham√≥ s√°sta

[?]
T√° s√© in am duinn, its time to do this
F√°gaim sl√°n le mo pensioner mates
Seo c√∫pla punt sa bhreis and don‚Äôt forget to close the gate
Imionn liom chun bualadh le M√≥gla√≠
[?]
Sweet, cr√≠ochnaithe anois amigo
Bucking old people, I‚Äôm an opposite pedo
Rock√°il suas ag an p√°irc agus tch√≠m na dissies
Le phus m√≥r orth√∫
Cause I‚Äôm blowing them kissies
Whats happening fellas now don‚Äôt be getting jealous
I‚Äôll take you‚Äôs all out for a Goodfellas next
'Nois beagnach de√°nta
Ach t√° trup m√≥r call√°n
Dj Pr√≥va√≠ agus a mhac on a tandem
Caide an craic boys
And he whips out his handgun
Sin an deireadh leis na RA men
Sin an deireadh leis na RA men
N√≠l an f√°ilte roimh an tandem
You looking yokes cause I have them
You looking yokes cause I have them

Na cunts, ag cur am√∫ mo chuid ama
Na blunts, n√≠l faic i mo mh√°la
Na funds, t√° seo ag iarraidh c√°sta
Ach ar an laghad t√° do mham√≥ s√°sta

Na cunts, ag cur am√∫ mo chuid ama
Na blunts, n√≠l faic i mo mh√°la
Na funds, t√° seo ag iarraidh c√°sta
Ach ar an laghad t√° do mham√≥ s√°sta

Maggie from the Upper Falls what‚Äôs happening
Shout out to dirty Deirdre from Divis
T√° a fhios agaibh an craic
Any age, any sex
Riding old folk from any postcode
