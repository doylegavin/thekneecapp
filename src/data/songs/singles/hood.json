H.O.O.D Lyrics
[Tús: Móglaí Bop]
Here, tell him
Who's the most violent person you know except Arlene
(Ha ha ha ha ha haaaa) Oh that would be you kid (ha ha ha ha) Respect

[Véarsa 1/Verse 1: Mo Chara]
Focain caite amach arís
Barraíocht piontaí le barraíocht snaois
Equals a cocktail brave for unleashin’ the beast
Oíche mhór amach fuinne, at least

Troid eile, he’s beatin’ some fella
Tá an R.U.C. anseo anois [?] eile
Fucked in to the back of the jeep, he falls asleep
He does it every week

[Droichead 1: Mo Chara]
Tiocfaidh ár lá, get the Brits out lad!
A one way ticket please I’ve lost my bus pass

[Véarsa 2: Mo Chara]
Isteach san offie
He’s lookin’ some tins man
Ag cailleadh focan foighde anois man

“Keep 'er lit ta fuck or fuckin’ fuck off” Jesus said on the cross
Two tins of Boost, 20 fegs and the fuck is still lost
Who’s next, me miss, son would you like a bag?
For your shopping, not your nose, I see your ankle tag
See Kneecap Live
Get tickets as low as $81

Fuck you curfew, dislocated eyesocket
Overnight, cop shop with two grams in his pocket
Just his reputation now he’s known for being a rocket
In his dreams 9mm loaded...

[Cúrfa: Móglaí Bop & Mo Chara]
I’m a H - Double O - D. Low life scum, that’s what they say about me
‘Cause I’m a H - Double O - D. Low life scum, that’s what they say about me

[Véarsa 3: Móglaí Bop]
A dog with a job, what the fuck is that?
When our poor Micky’s just sittin’ in the flat
Sippin’ on his cans and smokin’ rollies
‘Cause all the best jobs are taken by the dolies

[Véarsa 4: Móglaí Bop]
Squidgy black, yeah craic, and mo spliff achan lá
Beat the fash and the sesh, get that note off my car
Ach anois, Hector’s stash, má tá pús san áit
Ach ar dtús, cúpla líne, sula n-éiríonn seo aisteach

[Droichead 1: Móglaí Bop & Mo Chara]
It’s gonna be a blood bath
It’s gonna be a blood bath
It’s gonna be a blood bath
(It’s gonna be a blood bath)
[Véarsa 5: Móglaí Bop & Mo Chara]
Throw a hook, a jab and a boot
I sneak a quick toot then I fire another boot
For callin’ me a fruit
For tryna take the loot
But Billy won’t be bothering anymore hoods

‘Nois cúpla ceist, do ya want it in your chest?
Or your knees or your head?
DJ Próvaí has the lead
You can beg, you can plead, you can tell us what we needYou can change your name
But you’re all the fuckin’ same

[Cúrfa: Móglaí Bop & Mo Chara]
I’m a H - Double O - D. Low life scum, that’s what they say about me
‘Cause I’m a H - Double O - D. Low life scum, that’s what they say about me
I’m a H - Double O - D. Low life scum, that’s what they say about me
‘Cause I’m a H - Double O - D. Low life scum, that’s what they say about me
