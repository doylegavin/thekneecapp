THE RECAP (Bootleg Version) Lyrics
[Intro]
There‚Äôs a little bit of breaking news to bring you
And that is that counter terrorism police will investigate the rap trio, Kneecap

[Verse 1: : Mo Chara]
Motha√≠omse blessed
Le titim de do wreck
Le d'fhoireann ch√∫ltsr√°id
T√°im sa t√≥ir ar do r√©iteach
An rialtas anois in bits
Kneecap gave them a frisk
Spor√°n le nota√≠
But we know they've got more than this
Gr√©im l√°imhe and we'll stroll to the bank
Gimme Kemi's money and give her my thanks
We'll call it reparations, Badenoch, ya wank
Tried to take my money but I came and collected it back

[Chorus]
Nah, nah, nah
Imithe le fada
It's Kneecap, the recap;
R√≠the Bh√©al Feirste
Nah, nah, nah
Imithe le fada
Ar chr√≥naigh sibh Prova√≠, M√≥gla√≠ Bap agus Mo Chara
See Kneecap Live
Get tickets as low as $81

Nah, nah, nah

R√≠the Bh√©al Feirste
Nah, nah, nah
Imithe le fada
Ar chr√≥naigh sibh Prova√≠, M√≥gla√≠ Bap agus Mo Chara

[Verse 2: M√≥gla√≠ Bap]
Kemi ya wally
T√° an scr√≠obhneacht ar na balla√≠
You like to think that you're fooling everybody
But you're not
Just like the Iron Lady
Your career is gonna rot
T√° d'am de chac imithe ar smacht
Kneecap ar ais anois
Le rud a chur I gceart
Anseoa nd√©antar raic
T√° muid tinn de do chac
Kemi ya wally
T√° Maggie ag coladh ina leaba
Is cuma c√©n cinneadh
You just cumadh c√© chomh [?]
T√° t√∫ chomh l√°n de chac
Cos√∫il le do cheannaireacht
Go for a crack
Some fellas from the lower whack
[Bridge: Mo Chara]
When they see me
T√©ann na l√°imhe ina bpoca
Who's shouting yeah
Cos I'm here to stroke ya
Is maith liom na br√≥ga sin
Luadh couple of n√≥ta
Seems they suit me
I'll take them home lad
You backing up Badenoch
Cry into your sherry
Had enough Badenoch
You thought it's momentary
Called your bluff Badenoch
Belfast to Derry shouting
‚ÄúFuck Badenoch‚Äù

[Chorus]
Nah, nah, nah
Imithe le fada
It's Kneecap, the recap;
R√≠the Bh√©al Feirste
Nah, nah, nah
Imithe le fada
Ar chr√≥naigh sibh Prova√≠, M√≥gla√≠ Bap agus Mo Chara
Nah, nah, nah
Imithe le fada
It's Kneecap, the recap;
R√≠the Bh√©al Feirste
Nah, nah, nah
Imithe le fada
Ar chr√≥naigh sibh Prova√≠, M√≥gla√≠ Bap agus Mo Chara

[Outro: DJ Prova√≠]
Good effort, Kemi
Hard luck in the elections
Onwards and upwards
Free Palestine
