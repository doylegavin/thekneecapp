Guilty Conscience Lyrics
[M√≥gla√≠ Bap]
D√∫bh d√≥ite
In√°r su√≠ insan teach
Gan pingin rua againn le fi√∫ dhul amach
T√° m√© tinn tuirseach de bheith beo bocht
Ach t√° sin ar fad ag dhul le athr√∫ anocht
Mar t√° mise 'is Mo Chara ag cur le ch√©ile pleananna
'Is fuair muid ise √≥ doirte√°n, bham, bham, bham
Is roimh i bhfad beidh muid b√°ite insan airgead
Tuilte go maith gan dabht young renegade

Ag rith thart, tryna grab what we can
√ì amharc, Mo Chara, sin security van
"Now look man, don't wanna do you no harm
Just √©ist leis an sc√©al and I'm sure it'll be grand
'Cause my friend Mo Chara, he's a bit of a psycho
The type of fella loses the head at a typo
So whatever you do, do whatever he says
So √©ist Mo Chara, abair leis an craic if he says no

[Mo Chara]
M√≥gla√≠ get the noose, I'll proper introduce myself
I'm Mo Chara, and I'm not well, are yis ready for abuse?
Ach ar dt√∫s I'm sure you're thinking, Aw look
That I seem decent and clever, don't I feel bad for this ever?

[Chorus]
Guilty conscience, no thanks
I meditate and have plenty of wanks
And I never spare a second thought for cunts in suits
And when the revolution comes, I'm first out to loot
Yeah

New guds (new guds), happy days (happy days)
So much comfort when you don't have to pay
And when I'm happily tripped in designer gear
Then all of you cunts are getting one behind the ear
Yeah

[Mo Chara]
Go raibh maith agat M√≥gla√≠ , ar aghaidh linn in the stoley
O√≠che Shathairn, 'mon go haifreann
The collection box owes me
Agus t√° s√© te teola√≠
'is l√°n le pensioners homie
Tiocfaidh linn t√∫s a cur le gaelgiggolos ar√≠s if you're lonely
Money's no more stress, bu√≠ochas le G4S
T√° √°r bhfiacha ar fad √≠octha, now it's time to invest, huh?
Nah, I'm giving half to me ma
Some blood money for my honeys
And the rest to the 'ra
[Chorus]
Guilty conscience, no thanks
I meditate and have plenty of wanks
And I never spare a second thought for cunts in suits
And when the revolution comes, I'm first out to loot
Yeah

New guds (new guds), happy days (happy days)
So much comfort when you don't have to pay
And when I'm happily tripped in designer gear
Then all of you cunts are getting one behind the ear
Yeah

[Chorus]
Guilty conscience, no thanks
I meditate and have plenty of wanks
And I never spare a second thought for cunts in suits
And when the revolution comes, I'm straight out to loot
Yeah

New goods (new goods), happy days (happy days)
So much comfort when you don't have to pay
And when I'm happily tripped in designer gear
Then all of you cunts are getting one behind the ear
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
OBE's for the landlords
